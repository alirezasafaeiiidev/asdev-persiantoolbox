## Title

Internal-link integrity gate (no dead same-origin links)

## Status

DONE

## Context

Broken internal links harm UX and SEO, and currently exist risk-wise because some routes are disabled while components link to them. Add an automated “same-origin link exists” gate.

## Steps

1. Create a script to scan runtime code (`app`, `components`, `features`, `shared`) for `href="/..."` and `<Link href="/...">`.
2. Validate targets exist under `app/` OR are explicitly feature-flagged.
3. Integrate script into `pnpm ci:contracts` (deploy-blocking).

## Acceptance Criteria

- CI fails when a new broken internal link is introduced.
- Exceptions are explicit and reviewed.

## Dependencies

- Complements NP0-03.

## Files to modify

- `scripts/quality/*` (new)
- `package.json`
- `docs/TECHNICAL_SPEC.md` (optional)

## Implementation Notes

- Added deploy-blocking same-origin link integrity scanner: `scripts/quality/check-internal-links.mjs`.
- Scanner covers `app`, `components`, `features`, `shared` and validates static/dynamic app routes and public assets.
- Integrated into contracts gate via `pnpm quality:links:check` in `pnpm ci:contracts`.

## Verification

- `pnpm quality:links:check`
- `pnpm ci:contracts`
