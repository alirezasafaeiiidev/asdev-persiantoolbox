# Alireza Manual Task List (Outside Repo/Local)

Last updated: 2026-02-11

## P0 - Must Do First

1. Wait for NS activation to complete in Arvan panel (`g.ns.arvancdn.ir`, `o.ns.arvancdn.ir`).
2. In Arvan DNS, confirm required records exist and are correct:
   - `A @ -> 185.3.124.93`
   - `A www -> 185.3.124.93` (or `CNAME www -> @`)
   - `A staging -> 185.3.124.93`
3. In Arvan SSL/TLS settings, enable certificate issuance for:
   - `persiantoolbox.ir`
   - `www.persiantoolbox.ir`
   - `staging.persiantoolbox.ir`
4. Replace all placeholder production secrets (`change_me`) with real secure values:
   - `DATABASE_URL` password
   - `SUBSCRIPTION_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
   - `ADMIN_EMAIL_ALLOWLIST`
   - `ANALYTICS_INGEST_SECRET` (if analytics ingest is enabled)
5. Apply same real DB password in PostgreSQL user `persian_tools_prod` on VPS.

## P1 - Immediately After DNS Is Active

1. Manually verify public access:
   - `https://persiantoolbox.ir`
   - `https://www.persiantoolbox.ir`
   - `https://staging.persiantoolbox.ir`
2. Confirm Arvan proxy mode and SSL mode are consistent with origin setup (recommended: Full/Strict with valid origin cert).
3. Re-run production post-deploy checks in strict mode (`post_report_strict=true`) to finalize go-live verification.
4. Confirm admin route protection behavior from public domain: `/admin/site-settings`.

## P2 - Stability / Business / Ops

1. Set reminders for domain + CDN renewal dates (prevent accidental expiry).
2. Choose and activate alert destination (email/Telegram/SMS) for uptime + backup failures.
3. If needed, purchase/upgrade CDN/WAF plan based on expected traffic.
4. Keep an off-server copy of daily DB backups (object storage or secondary server).

## Done By Codex (No Action Needed From You Now)

1. Staging deploy is green and running.
2. Production deploy is green and running on VPS.
3. Automatic daily production DB backup cron is configured.
4. Deploy workflows and runbook were updated for DNS propagation phase.
