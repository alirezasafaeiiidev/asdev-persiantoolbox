# PersianToolbox — Next-Phase Backlog (Reality-Based)

This file summarizes the current next-phase execution stance.

- Canonical task list: `TASKS.md`
- Task specifications: `tasks-next/*.md`
- Real phased plan: `docs/ROADMAP_REAL.md`

## Current Truth

- Completed tasks: `24/24`
- Remaining tasks: `0/24`
- NP0 gate closed: all NP0 tasks DONE
- Production/staging runtime is healthy but still on older behavior for multiple disabled surfaces.

## Execution Rule

All NP0/NP1/NP2 tasks are closed for this release train.
No timeline commitments here; only dependency-driven sequencing.
